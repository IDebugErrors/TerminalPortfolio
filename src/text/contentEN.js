Self Driven-Self Motivated Student Constantly Experimenting with new and old-school technologies. Areas of work : Software Engineering \ Cloud Computing . I like to program, I like to research and implement software design techniques, learn how to structure projects, and how to write elegant code.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, I like to study programming languages, functional programming, clean code, and talk about AI, open-source, PC Hardware and tech in general. 
</p>
<p>
I have developed personal projects in which I work with web apps, APIs, bots, and databases. I used concepts of functional programming, object-oriented programming, REST API, and image processing.
My main focus is on four core areas of software engineering as of now :

<ul>
<li>Programming and software development in Java, C and C++</li>
